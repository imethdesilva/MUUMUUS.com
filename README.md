# MUUMUUS.com

In the CSW24 version (Collins Scrabble Words 24) there are 34,506 valid seven-letter words. I wanted to find a list of seven-letter words which are reduplicated.

For example, one of my favourite scrabble words "MUUMUUS" (which is a Hawaiin dress lol) is a reduplicated word. Driven with curiosity, I wanted to find all the seven letter words which follow a similar pattern. It would be cool to learn and play ATLATLS or TZITZIS the next time I play with an opponent.

Since Zyzzyva (best scrabble word search engine) didn't have an option for filtering out my specific need for this list, I decided to run a python script on all the seven letter words.

The code iterates through the entire 34,506 words and filts out the reduplicated sevens.

Precisely, I found out the existence of 50 such words. Approximately 0.14% of all seven letter words!

I added these sevens to a PDF in a nice UI and basically anyone can use it for their interest and benefit of playing or learning obscure words.
